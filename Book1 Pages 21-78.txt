A bus was rented at a fixed cost by a group of 30 people. When 10 people were added to the group, the fixed cost of the bus did not change,
but the charge for each person in the original group was $2 less than
before. If each person paid the same charge as each of the others, find the
fixed cost of renting the bus.
